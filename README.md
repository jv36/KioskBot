# A WORK IN PROGRESS: The bot is not currently usable. This, for now, is just a development test.

# **KioskBot**
## All of the headlines, now on Discord.

A simple Discord bot, created using the Discord.py library, that provides covers of global newspapers.

Powered by PressReader, SAPO, and others.

## Functionalities

### Autosending

Introducing Autosending, which allows you to set a channel, a certain time and a list of newspapers. Everyday, at that given time, KioskBot will automatically send the daily covers of the selected newspapers. 

*Fresh headlines everyday!*

### Date search

Select a date and a newspaper. KioskBot will send the cover of that newspaper from that day.

*It's like time travelling!*

### An extense list of publications

From newspapers to magazines, KioskBot has them all. Lots of countries are planned to be added but, in an initial stage, only Portugal press will be supported.

*Feels like looking at the news kiosk, huh?*

### And a lot more coming soon...

Do you have any suggestion on what to add to the bot in the future? Shoot me a DM on Discord! @joaovicente36

*Yeah, I need to think a little more.*
